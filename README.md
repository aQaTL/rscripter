# rscripter

# Recommended quick setup

I recommend leveraging [cargo-generate](https://github.com/cargo-generate/cargo-generate).

1. If you don't have cargo-generate already, install it:

```shell
cargo install cargo-generate
```

2. Generate your repo using this one as a template:

```shell
cargo generate aQaTL/rscripter
```
